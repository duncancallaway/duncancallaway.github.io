Ana Santasheva is a researcher working on practical solutions to advance the energy transition. She has a degree in Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo, five years of experience as a senior software engineer, and is completing a master’s degree from UC Berkeley’s Energy and Resources Group. Her work focuses on distributed energy resource (DER) integration, electrification planning, and grid modeling. Ana has developed tools like household electrification cost calculators and mapping platforms to help policymakers and utilities better understand and address the costs and benefits of energy system transitions.

Her current research includes building scalable grid models to support renewable energy adoption and developing cooperative energy management frameworks that improve grid resilience and equity. During her time at ERG, she has focused on techniques like optimization, game theory, and distributed control to address challenges in renewable energy systems. Ana’s goal is to create tools and models that utilities and communities can use to plan and manage equitable and resilient energy transitions.
